#### Manual installation <!-- omit in toc -->

Please click on the entry corresponding to your Anki version:

<details>

<summary><i>Anki 2.1</i></summary>

1. Make sure you have the [latest version](https://apps.ankiweb.net/#download) of Anki 2.1 installed. Earlier releases (e.g. found in various Linux distros) do not support `.ankiaddon` packages.
2. Download the latest `.ankiaddon` package from the [releases tab](https://github.com/glutanimate/speed-focus-mode/releases) (you might need to click on *Assets* below the description to reveal the download links)
3. From Anki's main window, head to *Tools* → *Add-ons*
4. Drag-and-drop the `.ankiaddon` package onto the add-ons list
5. Restart Anki

</details>

<details>

<summary><i>Anki 2.0</i></summary>

1. Go to *Tools* → *Add-ons* → *Open add-ons folder*
2. Find and delete the `Speed Focus Mode.py` file if it already exists.
3. See if you can find a `speed_focus_mode` folder. If so:
    1. If the folder contains a `meta.json` file, copy the file to a safe location. This will allow you to preserve your current settings.
    2. Proceed to delete the `speed_focus_mode` folder
4. Download and extract the latest Anki 2.0 add-on release from the [releases tab](https://github.com/glutanimate/speed-focus-mode/releases) (you might need to click on *Assets* below the description to reveal the download links)
5. Move the extracted `Speed Focus Mode.py` and `speed_focus_mode` into the add-ons folder
6. Optional: Place the `meta.json` file back into the directory if you created a copy beforehand.
7. Restart Anki
